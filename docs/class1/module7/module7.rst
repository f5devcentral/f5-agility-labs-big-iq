Class 7 - BIG-IQ DNS Sync Group Administration
===============================================

Goal:

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to manage the major DNS components
on the managed BIG-IP devices from BIG-IQ CM perspective. We will
**not** demonstrate the management of DNS application configuration
objects such as WideIP, Pool or Servers.

When you use F5® BIG-IQ® Centralized Management to manage your DNS sync
groups, the task becomes quite straightforward. You can do a quick
health check, diagnose health issues, and even set up an alert to notify
you if a sync group health issue occurs. You can view the DNS listeners
configured for the DNS sync groups you manage. You can view and modify
the properties for existing DNS profiles. You can also manage
permissions for DNS GSLB objects.

Tasks:

7.1: Check DNS Sync Group Health

7.2: Managing DNS Profiles

7.3: Managing DNS Listeners

7.4: Managing permissions for GSLB Objects
