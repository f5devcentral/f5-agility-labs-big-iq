Module 3 â€“ Automate device backups and archiving
=================================================

BIG-IQ provides the ability to backup individual or groups of managed
devices on an ad-hoc or a scheduled basis. The admin can decide how long
to retain the backups on BIG-IQ and has the option of archiving a copy
of the UCS backup off to an external device for DR or deeper storage
purposes.
