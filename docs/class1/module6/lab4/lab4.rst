Module 4: Deploy Staged Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have staged a number of changes on the BIG-IQ, we will evaluate the staged changes, and then deploy them to the BIG-IPs.

Navigate to **Deployment** on the top menu bar.

Navigate to **EVALUATE & DEPLOY > Local Traffic & Network**.

Click the **Deploy Now** button to push the changes to the BIG-IPs.
