Before you can import the certificate to BIG-IQ, you will need to export certificate/key from the managed BIG-IP device.

4. Log onto the TMUI interface of the **BOS-vBIG-IP01.temmarc.com** device to export the certificate/key pair.

Click System ›› Certificate Management ›› Traffic Certificate Management ›› SSL Certificate List ›› f5-ca-bundle

Click Export and then click on **Download f5-ca-bundle.crt** button to save the certificate to a file to a location that you can easily locate.

After saving the certificate file, click Cancel button to go back to previous screen.

5. Now, circle back to the BIG-IQ CM TMUI and go back to the Certificate Properties: State setting, click the Import button and then:

-  To upload the certificate's file, select Upload File and click the Choose File button to navigate to the certificate file you saved before.

Since this is a bundled certificate/key pair, you do not need to separately import the key file.

7. Click the Save & Close button. Your certificate/key pair is now **Managed** by BIG-IQ.
